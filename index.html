                <h3>Week 1: October 5, 2018</h3>
              <p>
                This week out goal was to lay the foundation for our project, which involved the following: establishing a website, coming up with a narrative, creating concept sketches and familiarzing ourselves with key features we will need in development. One of these features was the integration of the Virtual Reality Tool Kit (VRTK), which will help us streamline development moving forward. This is in part thanks to the built in prefabs for integration into Unity. Allowing for the Oculus rift to be programmed and demo'd real time, with or without a headset setup. But also cuts the time down in half, making objects interactable etc. thanks to the builder tools provided.

                <h3>Week 2: October 12, 2018</h3>
              <p>
                This week our team focused on working on the Design document for the VR environment. Due to this week and the following week being the time when most students have midterms, there was not the normal level of input. However, there was a lot of time spent on self-skill development in both the Unity and Maya software. As we had previously decided on moving forward working with a low poly art-style to allow for the use of imagination and increase production time of objects while focusing more on interaction over designed assets. We decided this would be the best choice. As such, Ricky has been working on animation in Maya which use the poly style, in addition to becoming proficient in GUID for the user in-game. Moving forward from this week, we plane to have a strong grasp on the direction we will be moving forward in. However, we are not sure of the specific scope yet. As the more details we implement the smaller the range. Furthermore, due to team skills being Asymmetrical we are still working towards an equal distribution of work for the coming weeks.

                <h3>Week 3: October 19, 2018</h3>
              <p>
                This week the team was focused primarily on the Assignment 3, in turn our focus for this week in regard to the project was planning over execution. Thus, we worked on come up with puzzle ideas for the environment we were designing. We came up with a variation of puzzle ideas for the environment, while Arthur was worked on the narrative story elements of the game. Planning out the design aspects, and the theme of the environment. We've started collecting assets, and using realistic lighting within Unity, to give a polygon, style with realistic lighting.

                <h3>Week 4: October 26, 2018</h3>
              <p>
                After team meeting, a decision was made to move towards a different genre of environment design. Moved away from the idea of an open world game towards a closed escape room environment. With a narrative shift to a detective looking for a missing person. A lot of assets/designs Ricky had come up with are no longer viable as the concept/theme is no longer low poly kid friendly, rather a dark tone with realistic lighting and graphics.

                Ricky finished setting up toolkits/started adding UI to opening scene/narration to setup for main scene. Also started working on an inventory system for the game assets, will not be placed on hold until level design is complete as it is not a high priority due to work to be done.

              <p>
                I finished working on the opening scene. Adding required assets and lighting to create desired mood in the scene. Limited movement and added necessary interacitity and a method of moving into the main scene.
                Learned about working with post processing and unity light assets to create depth and shodows. Began working on the main scene, as time is running out and teammates are struggling to make a functioning level design.

              <p>
                I started working on the main scene interactions and interactivity. Finished most of the base interactions and UI interactions. Including the following: adjust headset to fade to black to prevent seeing through walls, set teleport areas and non-teleport areas to prevent moving outside of desired space, setup access to bedroom puzzle.
                Collidors have been adjusted to allow objets to be placed within the cabinets and drawers, in addition to the walls. As well other various other Unity interactions.
                Took over teammates task of finishing the puzzle, as they were unable to create a functioning prototype. Started adding sound assets in 3D space. Prototype of full interaction has mostly been imlemented. For next week, finish adding in assets and interactive objects in the Living room, bedroom, and Kitchen. In addition to adding
                textures to the building.

                Finish environment, for both scenes and add an additional instruction scene to allow player to learn contorls. Plan out interactive environment being presented on the presentation day.
                Finish adding any additional information and documentation needed for the website, which currently requires some adjustments and re-uploading of sketches in a scaled down format. Touch up GDD, and sketches.
