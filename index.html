                <h3>Week 1: October 5, 2018</h3>
              <p>
                This week out goal was to lay the foundation for our project, which involved the following: establishing a website, coming up with a narrative, creating concept sketches and familiarzing ourselves with key features we will need in development. One of these features was the integration of the Virtual Reality Tool Kit (VRTK), which will help us streamline development moving forward. This is in part thanks to the built in prefabs for integration into Unity. Allowing for the Oculus rift to be programmed and demo'd real time, with or without a headset setup. But also cuts the time down in half, making objects interactable etc. thanks to the builder tools provided.

                <h3>Week 2: October 12, 2018</h3>
              <p>
                This week our team focused on working on the Design document for the VR environment. Due to this week and the following week being the time when most students have midterms, there was not the normal level of input. However, there was a lot of time spent on self-skill development in both the Unity and Maya software. As we had previously decided on moving forward working with a low poly art-style to allow for the use of imagination and increase production time of objects while focusing more on interaction over designed assets. We decided this would be the best choice. As such, Ricky has been working on animation in Maya which use the poly style, in addition to becoming proficient in GUID for the user in-game. Moving forward from this week, we plane to have a strong grasp on the direction we will be moving forward in. However, we are not sure of the specific scope yet. As the more details we implement the smaller the range. Furthermore, due to team skills being Asymmetrical we are still working towards an equal distribution of work for the coming weeks.

              <p>
                This week the team was focused primarily on the Assignment 3, in turn our focus for this week in regard to the project was planning over execution. Thus, we worked on come up with puzzle ideas for the environment we were designing. We came up with a variation of puzzle ideas for the environment, while Arthur was worked on the narrative story elements of the game. Planning out the design aspects, and the theme of the environment. We've started collecting assets, and using realistic lighting within Unity, to give a polygon, style with realistic lighting.
